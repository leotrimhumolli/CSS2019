## Run the app locally

Make sure that you have [Python installed](https://www.python.org/) on your machine.

You might want to use venv standard Python library to create virtual environments and have Python, pip and all dependent packages to be installed and served from the local project directory to avoid messing with system wide packages and their versions.
    
Clone the repository and get into it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leotrimhumolli/CSS2019.git
```
### Launching Jupyter 
All demos in the project may be run directly in your browser without installing Jupyter locally. But if you want to launch [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) locally you may do it be running the following command from the root folder of the project:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
After this Jupyter Notebook will be accessible by ``` http://localhost:8888. ``` and run the files [crawlerNominatedForDeletion.ipynb], [crawlerPersons.ipynb] and finally [plots.ipynb] to see the data analysis made for this research. 


## Project description

Research indicates that there is gender bias in Wikipedia, which should be tackled since Wikipedia is one of the major sources of information on the web. We study this bias by looking at the articles about persons that stayed inside Wikipedia but were challenged before they could stay. We look at the percentage of male/female pages that got nominated for deletion but then didn't get deleted on a year by year basis as well as cumulative.
